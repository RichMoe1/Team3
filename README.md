# Are Music Lyrics Changing Over Time?

## Project Overview

Pop music has changed over time: from rock to funk to country to hip hop, there is no denying the shift of Americans' taste in music. But, has it really changed? Can we analyze lyrics to show that music, according to some, has indeed become more negative? Or, can we finally debunk previous generations' complaint about today's music?

By utilizing Billboard Top 100 songs and analyzing their lyrics with Vader Sentiment Analysis for the last 50 years, we hope to answer this question.
